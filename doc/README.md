# Kitsu Documentation

> **Kitsu** — A modern version control system written in Rust.

Kitsu is a from-scratch VCS that reimagines version control with its own terminology, object model, and workflow. It uses **content-addressable storage** backed by SHA-256 hashing and zlib compression, **Ed25519 cryptographic signatures** for checkpoint integrity, and supports both **self-hosted SSH/SFTP registries** and a **Git bridge** for GitHub/GitLab integration.

**Current Version:** `0.0.1-alpha` · **License:** [UPL 1.0](../LICENSE.md)

## Quickstart

### 1. Build from source

```bash
# Prerequisites: Rust stable toolchain (edition 2024)
# Linux/macOS: libssh2, openssl, pkg-config
# Windows: no extra system deps needed

git clone https://github.com/jmaxdev/Kitsu.git
cd Kitsu
cargo build --release

# Binary is at target/release/kitsu (or kitsu.exe on Windows)
```

### 2. Initialize a repository

```bash
kitsu ignite
```

The **Ignite Assistant** will walk you through initial setup, including optional remote registry configuration (GitHub or custom SSH server).

### 3. Track files

```bash
kitsu track src/main.rs src/lib.rs
```

This stages files for the next checkpoint by hashing their contents and recording them in the binary stage file.

### 4. Create a checkpoint

```bash
kitsu freeze -m "Initial checkpoint"

# With Ed25519 signature:
kitsu freeze -m "Signed checkpoint" -S
```

### 5. View the timeline

```bash
kitsu timeline
```

### 6. Push to a remote registry

```bash
# SSH/SFTP (Sovereign Registry)
kitsu push origin main

# GitHub/GitLab (Git Bridge)
kitsu push origin main
```
